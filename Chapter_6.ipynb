C++ follows both object oriented and procedural programming paradigm. In OOP we make a lot of use of classes. Class generally refers to certain group of data that can be bundled in a same category.

Instead we can inherit it from just one place to whereever it is required. It's not only the function that we can inherit. We can also inherit variables and class itself. This helps us to keep our code clean and concise by allowing us to inherit functions(or varialbes) that are used in multiple classes.
